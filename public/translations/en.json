  "faq.iotube_used_for.one": "In addition to the immediate use cases for ioTube to bring new assets, data, and liquidity to the IoTeX Network, ioTube has the potential to greatly expand the capabilities of the IoTeX Network: by utilizing ioTube to port over the necessary crypto-assets and data, IoTeX has the potential to become a back-end processor for ${chain} and other blockchains.",
  "faq.iotube_used_for.two": "In the long-term, the unique assets generated by the IoTeX blockchain, such as IoT device data, can be used to trigger logic in smart contracts on ${chain} and other blockchains. In other words, IoTeX’s blockchain could serve as an oracle for non-IoTeX contracts, or vice-versa.",

When a token-lock action is detected on one blockchain, the pool of witnesses validates it and relays the finalized information to the other blockchain: here, the same amount of a \"Proxy-Token\" is minted. On the opposite, when a Proxy-Token burn is detected on one blockchain, the pool of witnesses validates it and relays the finalized information to the other blockchain, where the same amount of the original token is unlocked.",
  "faq.what_is_proxy_token": "What is a Proxy-Token?",
  "faq.proxy_token_is": "A \"Proxy-Token\" is a representation of another token that lives on a different blockchain (for example the ioWETH token on IoTeX could be the \"Proxy\" version on IoTeX of the WETH token on Ethereum).",
  "faq.what_different_proxy_token_and_original_token": "What is the difference between a Proxy-Token and the original token?",
  "faq.difference_between_proxy_token_and_original_token": "A Proxy-Token is an exact copy of the original token, it has the same properties, and can be used in the same ways as the original token: It just lives on a different blockchain than the original one.",
  "faq.does_the_token_supply_increase_when_using_iotube": "Does the token supply increase when using ioTube?",
  "faq.token_supply_does_not_increase": "No: The supply of the original token does never change as a result of using ioTube: ioTube bridge locks a certain amount of a token on one blockchain (essentially taking it out of circulation) and mints the exact same amount of a Proxy-Token on the other blockchain, that represents in all respects the original token (i.e. regenerating the locked supply). As a result, the circulating supply of the original token will stay the same: it's just split across two different blockchains instead of one.",

  "faq.happens_to_original_tokens": "Once you use ioTube to transfer your original tokens from Ethereum to IoTeX, the original tokens get stored and locked in the ioTube contracts: you do not own those tokens on Ethereum anymore. On the other side, you now own the same amount of Proxy-Tokens that gets sent to you on the IoTeX blockchain.",
  "faq.can_i_send_my_proxy_token_back": "Can I send my Proxy-Tokens back from IoTeX to Ethereum?",
  "faq.can_send_proxy_token_back": "Yes: you can send Proxy-Tokens from IoTeX to Ethereum at any time, and receive back the same amount of the original token on Ethereum.",
  "faq.can_i_transfer_as_many_or_limit": "Can I transfer as many tokens I want, or is there a limit?",
  "faq.transfer_limit": "To launch ioTube reliably, we have limited the min/max amount of the asset that can be moved around. These limits can be lifted once ioTube gets more stress validated.",
  "faq.can_i_send_native_iotex_tokens_using_iotube": "Can I send native IoTeX tokens to Ethereum using ioTube?",
  "faq.way_to_send_native_token": "Currently, ioTube only supports sending tokens from Ethereum to IoTeX by locking the tokens on Ethereum and minting their Proxy-Token version on IoTeX. You can send the Proxy-Tokens back from IoTeX to Ethereum at any time, but you cannot send a native IoTeX token to Ethereum yet - this feature will be available soon.",
  "faq.what_tokens_are_supported_by_iotube": "What tokens are supported by ioTube?",
  "faq.supported_tokens": "At the time of launch, ioTube supports WETH and PAXG Etehreum tokens: After the transfer you will receive the Proxy-Tokens on the IoTeX blockchain (ioWETH and ioPAXG respectively). More Ethereum tokens will be added soon.",
